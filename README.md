# AlexNet Chess Position Classifier

This project uses the power of AlexNet, a convolutional neural network, to identify whether a given chess position represents a Check or a Checkmate. By training the model on a vast collection of chess positions, we can accurately predict the state of the game.

## Introduction

Chess, one of the oldest and most popular board games, has a vast number of possible game states. For centuries, humans have been trying to understand and master this game. With the advent of deep learning and AlexNet, we can now automate the process of identifying important game states like Check and Checkmate.

## How it Works

We feed an image of a chessboard into our model, which has been trained on thousands of similar images. The model then uses the patterns it has learned to classify the image as either Check or Checkmate.

## Economic and Social Impact

The development of AI models like this one has broad implications in various sectors. Economically, it has the potential to contribute to the burgeoning AI market, as businesses find new ways to incorporate this technology into their products and services.

In the gaming industry, for example, an AI that can accurately predict chess states could be used to develop smarter, more challenging chess programs, attracting new customers and potentially increasing profits.

From an educational perspective, this tool can help chess learners to understand the game better, identifying crucial points in the game and providing valuable insights into how top players make decisions.

Furthermore, this project is a demonstration of the power of AI in problem-solving and decision-making processes. It could inspire the development of similar models for other complex problems, contributing to advancements in areas such as healthcare, climate change, and more.
